### I am Nando Schmidlin, a designer focusing on design-led innovation for sustainability. Building on a MA Design from Aalto University, Helsinki, my goal is to foster a future society which is co-creative, human-scale and cosmopolitan. Currently, I am involved at [moneynotlove](https://moneynotlove.ch) as the general secretary and at [Circular Hub](https://circularhub.ch) as project manager. Let's talk!

### I am Nando Schmidlin, a designer focusing on strategy and innovation. Having started my career in furniture design, I came to believe that a design process can be of incredible value when it is applied to more than products. With a Master of Arts in International Design Business Management and Creative Sustainability from Aalto University, Helsinki, I can contribute to a future society which is co-creative, human-scale and cosmopolitan. Recently, I have been invited to facilitate workshops and participate in panels on system innovation and circular design. Let's talk! [mail@nandoschmidlin.ch](mailto:mail@nandoschmidlin.ch)

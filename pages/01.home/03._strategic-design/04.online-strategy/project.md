Philip had been running Handydoktor GmbH for several years and it had grown into a mature business offering mobile phone related repair services in currently 7 cities across switzerland. He approached me with the wish to update their current identity. For a long time, their brand has been untouched. It looked outdated and was not responsive. At the very beginning it became clear that the brand values had to be better defined and that little tweaks would not be enough to differentiate the service from the strong and upcoming competitors. The first step was therefore to create a clear vision whereof the redesign of their website is only the first step. The created brand book is the outcome of that. The new brand, even though it links to the old identity in many ways, is much more modern and up to date. This requires a careful implementation, probably in parts, and this process is still ongoing.

The most exciting part of my Major in Design Management was a year-long project with an industry partner. Following the latest insights on innovation, our team was diverse, with multiple nationalities and disciplines, and used an open-ended, design-led process. The five of us were briefed to adjust the brand of 'Gustav Paulig Oy', the largest Finnish coffee roaster (and Finns drink the most coffee per capita!). The brand did not reasonate with the changing coffee scene, but we soon discovered that this was rooted in structural and organisational levels. Making full use of selected design methods (including a field trip to the US - nice), we put all our love and sweat into a future roadmap for Paulig. The results are covered by a NDA, and it will to be seen how much becomes a reality in a such a big organisation. Nonetheless, being able to apply our knowledge to a real case was incredibly valuable.

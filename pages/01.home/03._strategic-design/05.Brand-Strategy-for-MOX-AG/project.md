I have for a long time collaborated with the Zurich based furniture company MOX on diverse projects. As a small company, MOX finds itself in the influence of its context, rather than dictating it. To balance online and offline sales channels, quality manufacturing and product design is tough. They managed this challenge quite well and built a loyal customer base. Together, we have sharpened their vision of the future and translated this into a brand strategy. The strategy includes very concrete recommendations for building a coherent brand, a challenge for such a small company with no big marketing department.

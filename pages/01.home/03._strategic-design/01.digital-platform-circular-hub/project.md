At Circular Hub, I led the development of the digital platform that would present the two main offerings of the company, the online magazine and the course academy. The main challenge was to integrate the existing brand but also develop it further with minimal changes, so that it could iteratively be changed over time. Another challenge was to create a structure (both front and back end), that allowed users to navigate our current offer but left room for future scaling. This process of minimal resources and a bold vision is probably common to many startups and made it necessary to create a flexible and adaptable digital design system.

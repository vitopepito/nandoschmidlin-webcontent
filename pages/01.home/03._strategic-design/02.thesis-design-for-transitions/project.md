After months in the working, my thesis with the title "Design for Transitions: an Exploration of Practice" is finalised. It covers a background on system innovation and its relation to sustainability oriented design approaches, then introduces nine interviews with expert designers as additional material. Finally, I was able to unearth four steps helpful for anyone looking to adopt Design for Transitions in their work.

You are interested in the four step process that leads to more systemic impact in design practice? Start with reading the abstract, then head over to the complete Thesis in my University's [online library](http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:aalto-201805312785).

After World War II many Swiss designers wanted to help rebuilding Europe. To send their furniture as "Care Packages" to the surrounding countries, they designed folding and collapsing structures. 'Herr Ulrich & ich' is an armoire that sees itself in the tradition of these minimal but elaborated pieces.

The construction with a load-bearing wrap, which is put in shape through the shelves is not only visually appealing. In just a few minutes 'Herr Ulrich & ich' is established. At the same time, the compartments remain highly flexible and adapt to any use. With a weight of mere 18.5 kg the armoire is easy to carry around.

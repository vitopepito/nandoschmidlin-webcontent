The german term 'BÃ¼ro machen' summarises all the office work we do for our private lives, like paying bills, sending letters, answering emails. I spent a long time searching for the smallest, but large enough area, to do such work. It turns out to be 42 by 77 cm. The sheet metal top of Storch has multiple purposes to accommodate the daily mess of paper, pens, laptops and cables, without being openly multi-functional. It sports a fragile elegance, is mobile and light.

Storch was exhibited in Zurich and Cologne and is now part of the permanent collection of the 'Zurich Design Museum'.

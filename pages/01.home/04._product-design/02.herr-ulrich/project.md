After World War II many swiss designers seeked to help rebuilding the destroyed europe. To send their furniture as "Care Packages" to the surrounding countries, they worked with techniques of bending, folding and plugging. 'Herr Ulrich & ich' is an armoir that sees itself in the tradition of those simple but elaborated pieces

The construction with a load-bearing wrap, which is put in shape through the shelves is not only visually appealing. In just a few minutes 'Herr Ulrich & ich' is established. At the same time, the compartments remain highly flexible and adapt to any use. While folding together takes just as long, with a weight of mere 18.5 kg the armoire is easy to carry around.

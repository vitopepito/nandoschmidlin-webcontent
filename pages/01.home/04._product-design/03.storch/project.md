The german term 'BÃ¼ro machen' summarises all the office work we do for our private lives, like paying bills, sending letters, answering emails. For such work, Storch is ideal. I spent a long time searching for the smallest, but large enough area. The area has multiple purposes to accomodate the daily mess of paper, pens, laptops and cables, without being openly multi-funcitonal. It sports a fragile elegance, is mobile and light.

Storch was exhibited in Zurich and Cologne and is now part of the permanent collection of the 'Zurich Design Museum'. It is available in stores accross the globe.

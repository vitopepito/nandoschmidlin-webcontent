My thesis covers the background on system innovation and its relation to sustainability oriented design approaches, then introduces nine interviews with expert designers as additional material. Finally, I was able to unearth four steps helpful for anyone looking to adopt Design for Transitions in their work. Head over to the complete thesis in my University's [online library](http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:aalto-201805312785).

'Gustav Paulig Oy' - the largest Finnish coffee roaster (and Finns drink the most coffee per capita!) - hired us to develop a younger and more digital experience of their coffees. The brand did not resonate with the changing coffee scene, but we soon discovered that this was rooted in structural and organisational levels. Making full use of selected design methods (including a field trip to the US - nice), we put all our love and sweat into a future roadmap for Paulig. The results are covered by a NDA, and it will to be seen how much becomes a reality in a such a big organisation.

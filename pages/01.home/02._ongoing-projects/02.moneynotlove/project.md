Over the last years I have dedicated much love to one goal: Improving the situation of design in Switzerland. Many young design graduates struggle with the problem of an uncertain job market. The current institutions provide no clear guidelines for independent creatives, and the the creatives themselves lack a platform for exchange. moneynotlove is a community of creatives who share their knowledge and highlight the relevance of design in society.
